Data Structures Notes
This repository contains notes I have taken while studying data structures. These notes focus specifically on ArrayList and Hashtable data structures. Both of these data structures are commonly used in software development and are useful in various scenarios.

Contents
This repository contains notes on the following topics:

1. Method
Basic information about methods and functions.
Parameters, return values, and method signatures.
Examples of how to use methods with different data structures.
2. ArrayList
